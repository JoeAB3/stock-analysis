# Stock Analysis VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
Using historic Kickerstarer campaigns across several years and mediums to understand 
success vs failure

### General Overview
To "refactor" the current VBA code to make it run faster.  

## Purpose
As sometimes VBA code takes quite a while to run, the purpose of this project is to make it run faster and easier.  I added a "refactor" button to 
make it easier for Steve to run.

### Results
The "refactored" analysis does run faster (see the attached readme file)

As far as the results of the stock analysis...
Of the 12 stocks picked in 2017, only 2 remained a good investment.  Those stocks are ENPH(+81.9%) and RUN(+84%).  
The other 10 stocks had an average return of -26.8% decline for the year.
That being said, many of these stocks had an increased return over the previous year.  That shows the plan of investing in "green stocks" remains sound.

### Summary
There are may advantages and some disadvantages to refactoring code.  The most notable advantages are makeing the script run faster, 
also make it smaller.  It also gives the programmer the opportunity to clean up the script.  
The simplest disadvantage (in my opinion) is the "if it isn't broke don't fix it" approach.  If it runs correctly, sometimes there's not a need
to refactor.  It can add a layer of unnecessary complexity, and confusion to the script.
